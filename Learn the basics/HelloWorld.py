# A computer program is the method by which we talk with computer
# and instruct it to carry out some task so first let's teach computer to talk
# below is the hello world program

# To make computer talk print() syntax is used in python
# Strings are placed between ""(double quotes)
print("hello World")

# or '' (single quotes)
print('hello world')

# "" are useful as we could print strings containing single quotes('') e.g:-
print("Let's Go")
# the above mentioned print would have not been possible if we would have used ('')


# the followint code would work in python 2
# python 2 allows print syntax as below remove # in line 15 to see it work
#print "hello world"
# above mentioned code would result int error in python 3
